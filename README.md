# YouTube Uninterrupted

A Firefox extension that prevents YouTube from interrupting your viewing experience with the "Continue watching?" dialog. Perfect for music playlists, podcasts, long-form content, and ambient videos.

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.5.0-green.svg)](manifest.json)


**Current Version:** v1.5.0

## Purpose

YouTube automatically pauses videos after a period of inactivity and displays a "Video paused. Continue watching?" prompt. This extension removes that interruption, allowing uninterrupted playback for legitimate use cases such as:

- 🎵 Music playlists and albums
- 🎙️ Podcasts and long-form content
- 🌙 Ambient videos (rain sounds, lo-fi, etc.)
- 📚 Educational content and lectures
- 🎮 Livestreams and VODs

**Note:** This extension does NOT block advertisements or interfere with YouTube's monetization. It only prevents the passive viewing timeout prompt.

## Features

- ✅ **Automatic Dialog Removal** - Three-layer defense system ensures the dialog never appears
- ✅ **Mobile & Desktop Support** - Works on both www.youtube.com and m.youtube.com
- ✅ **Minimal Permissions** - Only requests access to YouTube, nothing else
- ✅ **Zero Data Collection** - All processing happens locally, no tracking whatsoever
- ✅ **Lightweight** - Minimal CPU/memory footprint, won't slow down your browser
- ✅ **Easy Toggle** - Simple on/off switch in the popup
- ✅ **Privacy First** - No external connections, no telemetry, fully transparent

## How It Works

The extension uses a multi-layered approach for maximum reliability:

### Layer 1: CSS Injection
Instantly hides the dialog using targeted CSS rules before JavaScript even loads.

### Layer 2: DOM Monitoring
A MutationObserver watches for the dialog being inserted into the page and removes it immediately.

### Layer 3: Activity Simulation
Periodically simulates minimal user activity (mouse movement event) every minute to reset YouTube's idle timer, preventing the dialog from triggering in the first place.

## Installation

   ```

2. **Load as Temporary Add-on** (for testing)
   - Open Firefox
   - Navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
   - Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
   - Select the `manifest.json` file from the extension folder
   - The extension will remain active until you restart Firefox

3. **Permanent Installation** (recommended)
   - Create a Firefox Add-on Collection (see below)

   - Click "Create a collection"
   - Name it (e.g., "My Extensions")
   - Note your User ID and Collection name

3. **Add Extension to Collection**

   - You should see "Active on YouTube pages"
   - The toggle should be ON (red)

3. **Play a Video**
   - Start any video
   - Let it play without interaction

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working

**Issue:** Dialog still appears

**Solutions:**
1. Verify the extension is enabled
   - Click the extension icon
   - Ensure toggle is ON
   
2. Check if extension is active on current page
   - Extension only works on `*.youtube.com` domains
   - Not in YouTube mobile app (apps don't support extensions)
   
3. Reload the YouTube page
   - Press F5 or Ctrl+R (desktop)
   - Pull down to refresh (mobile)
   
4. Check Firefox console for errors
   - Press F12 → Console tab
   - Look for errors starting with `[YouTube Continue]`


### Extension Icon Not Visible (Desktop)

**Issue:** Can't find the extension icon

**Solutions:**
1. Check if extension is installed
   - Go to `about:addons`
   - Look for "YouTube Uninterrupted"
   
2. Pin the extension to toolbar
   - Right-click toolbar → Customize Toolbar
   - Drag extension icon to toolbar

### Mobile: Extensions Not Available

**Issue:** Can't add extensions on Firefox Android

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure you're using **Firefox** (not Chrome or other browsers)
2. Firefox for Android requires custom collections (see installation)
3. Use Firefox Nightly for easier development/testing

### Dialog Appears on First Page Load

**Issue:** Dialog shows once when first opening YouTube

**Why:** The content script needs a moment to initialize

**Solution:** This is expected behavior. The dialog won't appear again during that session.

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The extension implements three defensive layers:

**Layer 1: CSS Injection (`inject-styles.css`)**
- Injected at `document_start` for instant effect
- Uses `!important` flags to override YouTube's inline styles
- Targets multiple selectors for resilience

**Layer 2: DOM Monitoring (`youtube-uninterrupted.js`)**
- MutationObserver watches for dialog insertion
- Debounced callbacks (100ms) for performance
- Multiple selector strategies for reliability
- Automatically removes or hides detected dialogs

**Layer 3: Activity Simulation (`youtube-uninterrupted.js`)**
- Dispatches mouse movement events every minute
- Resets YouTube's idle timer
- Prevents dialog from triggering in the first place
- Non-intrusive, doesn't interfere with actual user actions

### Performance

- **CPU Usage:** Negligible (event-driven, no continuous polling)
- **Memory Usage:** < 1MB
- **Network Impact:** Zero (no external requests)
- **Battery Impact:** Minimal (optimized intervals)

### Compatibility

| Platform        | Minimum Version | Status          |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Firefox Desktop | 147.0           | Fully supported |
| Firefox Android | 147.0           | Fully supported |
