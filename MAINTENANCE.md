## Renovate Integration

This repository is configured to use [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) for automated dependency updates.

### How to Enable Renovate

1.  Navigate to the [Renovate GitHub App page](https://github.com/apps/renovate).
2.  Click **Install**.
3.  Select your organization or personal account.
4.  Choose "Only select repositories" and select `youtube-uninterrupted` (or "All repositories" if preferred).
5.  Click **Install** / **Save**.

Once installed, Renovate will detect the `renovate.json` file in this repository and create an Onboarding Pull Request. Merge this PR to activate Renovate.

### What Renovate Manages

-   **NPM Dependencies**: Checks `package.json` for updates to `web-ext` and other dependencies.
-   **GitHub Actions**: Checks `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for updates to actions like `checkout` and `setup-node`.

### Configuration

Renovate is configured in `renovate.json`. It is currently set to:
-   Extend generic base configuration.
-   Group minor and patch updates for all packages into a single PR (`all-non-major`) to reduce noise.
-   Automatically merge these minor/patch updates if CI passes (Automerge).
